# Vampire: The Masquerade Fifth Edition Online Dice Roller
## What is it?
This app is a roller for the VTM V5 tabletop RPG ruleset, built on Angular and Bootstrap.
## Why?
I went looking for one and couldn't find any that used the cute symbols on the dice for successes and failures. Plus most VTM specific tools I found were from V20 or before. Sure, you could just use a generic dice roller and ask it for a bunch of d10s, but what's the fun in that?
## What can it do?
The app can roll a pool of 1 to 20 dice, including 0-5 possible hunger dice as part of that. If you know the difficulty, it will tell you the result, as well as the individual values rolled, and will let you choose and reroll up to 3 normal dice, in the case that you spend a willpower to do so. If your ST likes to keep secrets and won't reveal the difficulty of the roll, you can still make it, see the values, and perform a willpower reroll. In this case, it will also suggest that you may have bestially failed or messy critted, to be determined by the Storyteller when they reveal whether you succeeded the test or not.
## Any plans for other features?
I wanted to build in a system for rouse checks specifically, but that seemed redundant right now since that could be replicated with a pool of 1 and no hunger. Eventually I'd love to incorporate recorded character attributes and skills into the roller- even a full character sheet, but at this point I really just wanted to see what I could get done in a day or so.
